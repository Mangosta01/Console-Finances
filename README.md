Financial records Analysis with Javascript


## Description

The Week 4 javascript code  project consisted of creating code for analyzing the financial records of a company. We were provided with a financial dataset in the `starter/index.js` file.

We were given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses.

My task was to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  * You will need to track what the total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average.
  * (`Total/Number of months`)

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
